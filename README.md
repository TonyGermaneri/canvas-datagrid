## Installation

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-datagrid)

```console
npm install canvas-datagrid
```

Place the single source file `./dist/canvas-datagrid.js` in your web page using a script tag that points to the source or use webpack.

```html
<script src="dist/canvas-datagrid.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, instead of downloading and installing, you can link directly to an NPM CDN like [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com).

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/canvas-datagrid"></script>
```

A function will be added to the global scope of the web page called `canvasDatagrid` as well as module loader definitions.

## Getting started

Works [with webpack](https://canvas-datagrid.js.org/amdDemo.html), [without webpack](https://canvas-datagrid.js.org/demo.html) or as a [web component](https://canvas-datagrid.js.org/webcomponentDemo.html).
No matter how you load it, `canvasDatagrid` is declared in the global scope.

Canvas-datagrid is a [Web Component](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/TonyGermaneri/canvas-datagrid) when
in a compatible browser, otherwise it is a `<canvas>` tag.

## Using pure JavaScript

```js
var grid = canvasDatagrid();
document.body.appendChild(grid);
grid.data = [
  { col1: 'row 1 column 1', col2: 'row 1 column 2', col3: 'row 1 column 3' },
  { col1: 'row 2 column 1', col2: 'row 2 column 2', col3: 'row 2 column 3' },
];
```

## Using Web Component

<!--
```
<custom-element-demo>
  <template>
    <script src="https://canvas-datagrid.js.org/canvas-datagrid.debug.js"></script>
    <div style="height: 300px;"><next-code-block></next-code-block></div>
  </template>
</custom-element-demo>
```
-->

```html
<canvas-datagrid class="myGridStyle" data="data can go here too"
  >[ {"col1": "row 1 column 1", "col2": "row 1 column 2", "col3": "row 1 column
  3"}, {"col1": "row 2 column 1", "col2": "row 2 column 2", "col3": "row 2
  column 3"} ]</canvas-datagrid
>
```

or

```js
var grid = document.createElement('canvas-datagrid');
grid.data = [
  { col1: 'row 1 column 1', col2: 'row 1 column 2', col3: 'row 1 column 3' },
  { col1: 'row 2 column 1', col2: 'row 2 column 2', col3: 'row 2 column 3' },
];
```

## Using Vue

```vue
<canvas-datagrid :data.prop="[{"col1": "row 1 column 1"}]"></canvas-datagrid>
```

- [XHR data paging demo Jeopardy Questions API](https://canvas-datagrid.js.org/xhrPagingDemo.html)

Note about XHR paging demo: Thanks to [jservice](http://jservice.io/) for the use of the free paging API. You must "load unsafe scripts" or relevant command to allow HTTPS (github) to make XHR requests to HTTP (Jeopardy Questions API). There is nothing unsafe about this.

## Building & Testing

To install development dependencies. Required to build or test.

    npm install

To build production and debug versions:

    npm run build

To build documentation:

    npm run build:docs

To build types:

    npm run build:types

To run tests. Note: Headless tests will mostly fail due to lack of headless canvas pixel detection support. Use VM testing or your browser.

    npm test

### Windows 10 WSL Testing
*This is info for wsl version 1. v2 seems to be [different](https://dev.to/davelsan/comment/nnf5).*

- `CHROME_BIN` needs to be set to the location of your Google Chrome exe in Windows. (e.g. `/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe`)
   *in WSL, `export CHROME_BIN='path/to/chrome'`*
- Chrome needs access to [karma's temp folder](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56204265/292067).
  - Create a `tmp` folder on the same Windows drive as your repo.
  - set `TEMP` to a folder that exists on the same Windows drive as your repo. (matching capitalization probably matters)
    *in WSL, `export TEMP='/Temp/karma'`, if your repo is on drive C, then create folder C:\Temp\karma*
- karma.conf.js needs to be edited
  - Change the browser from `ChromeHeadless` to `Chrome`
  - Modify to run ChromeHeadless without sandboxing. This is not ideal, but it seems to be necessary in [WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/3282) and [Linux containers](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/chrome#sandboxing) ([see also](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-chrome-launcher/issues/158#issuecomment-339265457))
    - Add a custom launcher
      ```
      customLaunchers: {
        ChromeHeadlessNoSandbox: {
            base: 'ChromeHeadless',
            flags: ['--no-sandbox']
        }
      }
      ```
    - Change the browser from `ChromeHeadless` to `ChromeHeadlessNoSandbox`
