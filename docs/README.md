# On documentation

This directory contains the documentation for canvas-datagrid. It's a combination of static Markdown files
located in `docs/` and Markdown files generated by `jsdoc-to-md.js`, based on the JSDoc annotations in the
the source code (specifically, `lib/docs.js` and `lib/publicMethods.js`).

The documentation build system is [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). For more details on how it all works,
please visit the documentation for Docusaurus. While the documentation system is built and published
automatically when a new release is made, it helps to know how to do it locally, for when modifying or adding
pages.

In `docs/`

```
npm run build
```

This will first run `jsdoc-to-md.js`, which parses all the JSDoc annotations in `lib/docs.js` and `lib/publicMethods.js`
and then generates Markdown files in `docs/reference`. These files are generated using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates located in `templates/`

After that, Docusaurus will build these and the remainder of the pages,compiling and packaging everything into a React app.

More convenient when authoring documents, though, is running

```
npm run docusaurus
```

This will run the Docusaurus development server, compiling and refreshing documents as you modify them.

## Adding document to sidebar

The sidebar (left) will contain links to the documents in `docs/`. This table of contents is generated in the file `sidebars.js`. When adding a document, and you don't see it show up in the sidebar, you'll probably have to add it manually in `sidebars.js`
